## Description

This page serves to display my work in a consice and easy to follow structure while demonstrating my skills in HTML and CSS. The main issues that arose in development was exact positioning and flow. In the future, I hope to implement some Javascript elements and clean up some of the more redundant and messy coding.

## System Requirements

In order for this page to function properly, the index.html file as well as the assets folder, containing the images and style.css files must be available.
